# Linkedin_extractor
This is actually a proof of concept to take data from LinkedIn and see what I can do with it.

Since LinkedIn is actually quite tricky to scrap, I had to use Selenium.

I did this over Jupyter Notebooks as I was just debugging while developing. An actual process would go in a python project with classes and nicely coded (not like this project) :) 

I would not recommend anyone to copy this code for an actual processing. Use it if you need to check how to scrap a website that uses javascript like LinkedIn does.
